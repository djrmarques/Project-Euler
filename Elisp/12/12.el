;; The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
;; 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
;; Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
;;      1: 1
;;      3: 1,3
;;      6: 1,2,3,6
;;     10: 1,2,5,10
;;     15: 1,3,5,15
;;     21: 1,3,7,21
;;     28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
;; We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
;; What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
